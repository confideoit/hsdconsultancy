  "introduction": "Networking is a core part of cloud infrastructure. This blog explains GCP networking concepts including VPCs, subnets, firewalls, and load balancing, helping you design secure and scalable cloud networks.",
  "description": "GCP networking provides secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity for cloud resources. It includes Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, firewalls, load balancers, and hybrid networking options for enterprise needs.",
  "mainContent": "### Key Concepts\n- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** – Isolated network environment for your cloud resources.\n- **Subnets** – Segments of a VPC to organize resources.\n- **Firewalls** – Rules controlling inbound and outbound traffic.\n- **Load Balancing** – Distributes traffic across multiple resources for high availability.\n- **Hybrid Connectivity** – VPN and Interconnect for on-premises integration.\n\n### Use Cases\n- Secure multi-tier applications.\n- High availability web services.\n- Hybrid cloud deployments.\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use separate subnets for different workloads.\n- Apply least-privilege firewall rules.\n- Monitor network traffic and performance.\n- Implement global load balancing for scalable applications.",
